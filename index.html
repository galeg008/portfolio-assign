      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>My name is Giovanni, most people refer to me as Gio. I am thirty-two years old and consider myself an ambivert. I'm a photographer and love to travel. 
      I do side job photo events such as engagments, maternity, family portaits, and headshots. I'm also employed with Costco Wholesale as a service clerk and marketer.
      I've recently decided to expand my skills by joining the UCI coding bootcamp and I'm hoping it opens doors to a new adventure.
      I would like to take on launching my own photography website to expand my clientel but I'm looking forward to experiencing a change of workplace 
      challenge myself but also continue being creative. For now, enjoy some of my work.
    </p>
